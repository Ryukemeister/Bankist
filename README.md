# Welcome to Bankist

'Bankist' is a minimalist landing page for a fictional bank. This is one of the projects that I've created from the Udemy course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!'. In order to provide our end user with a smooth scrolling experience, this project uses many DOM techniques such as event propagation, event delegation, smooth scrolling and the Intersection Observer API. So head over to https://bankist-your-digital-bank.netlify.app to experience a hassle-free banking experience.
