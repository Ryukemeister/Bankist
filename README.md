Bankist is the landing page of a fictional bank known as 'Bankist'. It is one of the projects that I've created from the Udemy course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert !' by Jonas Schmedtmann. This project uses a lot of DOM techniques such as event propagation, event delegation, smooth scrolling and it also uses the Intersection Observer API in order to create a smooth scrolling experience for our end user.
