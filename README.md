Bankist is the landing page of a fictional bank known as 'Bankist'. It is one of the projects that I've created from the Udemy course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert !' by Jonas Schmedtmann. This project using a lot of DOM techniques such as event propagation, event delegation, smooth scrolling and also the use of the Intersection Observer API to display elements on scroll.
